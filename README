Bambot - A simple IRC bot.

This project is still relatively young and immature. As a result it hasn't
been documented yet. I'm just throwing this together as a quick little
get-you-started. I wouldn't consider it production ready, though for all
intents and purpose I do run it "in production" for my own personal uses.

=INSTALLATION=

The module currently consists of just a single package file and a single
program file. In practice this is all you need and you can install them
however you wish.

That said, the project does include a rudimentary Makefile.PL that uses
ExtUtils::MakeMaker to generate a Makefile to install with. The usual
procedure can be used to install it:

  perl Makefile.PL && make all install

Whether or not you require root to do so will depend on your environment.
I'd recommend installing into a personal local::lib or perlbrew setup
rather than into the whole system.

=CONFIGURATION=

Bambot by default looks for $HOME/.bambot/config. This is a simple `name =
value' format. You can add comment lines with a prefix of '#', which
Bambot will effectively ignore. The minimal that you should specify here
is the host and master. For now that is all I'll describe to get you
started. You can look through the code to see what other configuration
options are available and what they do.

  host     The server to connect to. E.g., irc.freenode.net.

  master   The user and hostmask cloak of the master user. E.g.,
           user@unaffiliated/user. You should probably use a NickServ
           protected cloak so that the server requires a password to use
           it. The master user gets to control the bot more fully,
           including reloading the software, restarting it, or shutting
           it down. You probably don't want just anybody to be able to
           acquire this power.
