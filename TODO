* robust, internal logging instead of using shell and tee pipe.
* split bambot into multiple processes.
`-* The initial process will be the 'console'.
`-* The console will spawn a core daemon, that connects to IRC servers, speaks IRC, and relays work to worker nodes.
`-* Worker nodes will do the actual "work", such as processing requests, and generating responses.
`-* The processes will all speak to one another via sockets.
* SSL/TLS support.
* parsing of commands.
`-* at least into some concept of user/nick, command, and args.
  * possibly using an existing CPAN module for correctness.
* event-based handling of commands.
* abstract functionality into plugin system.
* throttled messages; limit number of automatic messages per interval.
`-* switch from whitelist to blacklist once throttling in place.
* 'word (sp?)' lookup word in dictionary...
* random messages when channel activity low.
`-* fortunes.
  * jokes.
* silly randomized "RPG" elements with HP/MP and stats (e.g., EXP) management. >:)
* add support for reading identify stuffz from netrc. See Net::Netrc.
